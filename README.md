# Wiedzminstvo
This mod is aiming to bring elements from the witcher world to the Minecraft one.
We promise nothing, but our aim is to bring monsters, alchemy, contracts
and some more stuff to the game. We work on this mod actively yet perhaps vaguely as we don't
have much free time in our personal lives.

lease enjoy our mod and if you want to help out, feel free to join our [discord](https://discord.gg/97bR4dZX)
